Practical Nine for Introduction to Computational Genomics

This practical is intended to quiz you

Download this repository, and create a Julia script that takes this [data](https://figshare.com/articles/Data_Carpentry_Genomics_beta_2_0/7726454?file=14502617) and creates and prints a three column array of the counts of genes per sample. You are allowed to use the aligner of your choice to align trimmed fatq files to the genome file, but you must use Julia to make the table of samples x genes. Create a practical.sh script which calls your Julia script with the included fasta file.
